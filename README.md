 <summary><h3> My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I started my coding journey when I was 14, It all begins when I noticed that the Windows XP calculator application was a bit ugly for me, so I decided to check on internet ‚Äúhow to create a calculator in widows‚Äù, that led me to a Youtube video of ‚ÄúHow to develop a calculator on Java‚Äù using Netbeans 5. After a few days I finished my own calculator and I loved it. When I was writing that code I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing, so for that reason I decided to learn Java by myself. When I learned Java, I developed a basic apps to, for example move file from one folder to other. The time pass and then I heard about python, it calls my attentions so I decided to try it, by just seen a 4 hours video of ‚Äúlearn Python in 4 hours‚Äù in Youtube, I learned how to make basic scripts and was then when I really began to write code. In that moment I was studying for my Electronic Engineer degree, so in my career I learned C, Visual Basic and C#. Since I got my degree as Engineer till now, I dedicate my time to learn some new languages such as Rust, javascript and Networking which is current my job. I‚Äôm a networking engineer and I work in the Automation and Cybersecurity area.
