**`One more bit in the matrix (Developer/Engineer/Gamer)`**

What has always driven me is figuring out how things actually work, whether that means reading and uderstanding the source code, digging into docs, or just breaking stuff to see what happens 😄 That curiosity's given me a pretty wide and deep view of how systems work together, and honestly, I love to understand everything.

It started with programming. I code mostly in Go, C, and Python, and I'll throw in some Bash when I need to glue things together or automate stuff. That tinkering habit naturally spilled over into Linux and Unix systems; I'm comfortable on pretty much any Linux distro. And yeah, I'll happily compile something from source just to see how it's built.

That same hands-on energy led me into networking too. I've worked with Cisco, Fortinet, and Mikrotik gear, setting up networks from scratch, debugging the usual headaches, and keeping things running. Along the way, I got really into automating repetitive tasks, whether through quick Python/Bash scripts or by designing systems that are both efficient and secure in Go.

These days, I'm applying all that to the cloud side, using AWS and Terraform to manage infrastructure, and diving into Kubernetes and GitOps to keep things up and running. It all ties back to that same itch: understand the pieces, connect them well, and build something that just awesome :)

 <summary><h3> My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my coding journey at the age of 14. It all started when I noticed that the Windows XP calculator application looked a bit outdated to me. This prompted me to search online for "how to create a calculator in Windows." My search led me to a YouTube video titled "How to Develop a Calculator in Java" using NetBeans 5. After a few days, I completed my own calculator and absolutely loved it. At the time, I didn't fully understand what I was doing while writing the code, so I decided to teach myself Java.
      
   Once I had learned Java, I developed basic applications, such as scripts to move files from one folder to another. As time passed, I heard about Python, which caught my attention. After watching a four-hour YouTube tutorial titled "Learn Python in 4 Hours," I gained enough knowledge to write basic scripts. That’s when I truly began to immerse myself in coding.
   
   At that point, I was pursuing my degree in Electronics Engineering, where I learned programming languages like C, Visual Basic, and C#. After graduating, I dedicated my time to exploring new languages and technologies, such as Rust, JavaScript, and networking—my current area of focus. Today, I work as a networking engineer specializing in automation and cybersecurity.
